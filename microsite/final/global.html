            <h1>The Global Movement</h1>
            <p>Tiny home movement started in the late 1990s and early 2000s and its popularity has increased globally and slowly defined itself. The movement's core involves living full time in a very low floor area building, either fixed or mobile. The structures have found niches in area's of those trying to downsize, short-term rentals, disaster relief 
            housing, homeless relief housing, and even art and/or youtube projects.</p>

British architect Richard Horden, at the Technical University of Munich, developed the Micro Compact Home (M-CH), a high-end small (76 sq ft) cube designed for 1–2 persons, with functional spaces for cooking, hygiene, dining/working, and sleeping.

        <p>Types of tiny houses that may be a part of this movement include shipping container homes, tiny cabins, small houseboats, bus conversions, and others. One of the differences between the tiny house movement and previous small living spaces is that they can actually have a higher cost per area than larger homes. Some concepts that go with the idea of the movement are about spending less money overall and using the space inside a house as effectively as possible.</p>

            <p>Although tiny homes and mobile homes have existed previously, the tiny house movement and its viral popularity occurred at increasing levels in the 21st century. In the 2010s and 2020s, television shows featuring various aspects of tiny houses became popular. Some point to the start of the trend in 1997, when someone tried to live successfully in a very small house. After two decades, some have noted that part of the appeal is for niche applications such as getting views on social media for interesting or shocking design, and once concern is that the concept has been over-hyped thus generating unrealistic expectations</p>

        <div class="text-column">
            <p>Henry David Thoreau and the publication of his book Walden are often quoted as an early inspiration for the tiny-house movement. The modern movement is considered to have started in the 1970s, with artists such as Allan Wexler investigating the idea of contemporary compact living. Early pioneers include Lloyd Kahn, author of Shelter, and Lester R. Walker, author of Tiny Houses. Sarah Susanka started the "counter-movement" for smaller houses, something she details in her book The Not So Big House.</p>
