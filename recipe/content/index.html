    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol class= "Directions">
        <li>Stir together the flour, salt, baking powder, and the optional sugar in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Work in the oil, using clean fingers to combine. Add the milk and water, working the liquids into the flour until a sticky dough forms. Pour in a bit more water if the dough isn’t sticking together as a rough shaggy mess.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface vigorously for 1 minute. The dough should be soft but feeling a bit sturdy and no longer sticky.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest, covered with a damp cloth, for 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 3 balls, cover the balls with the damp cloth, and let them rest for another 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll out each ball of dough on a lightly floured surface into a circle or rectangle approximately ¼-inch thick. If you have a tortilla roller, use it rather than a heavier rolling pin, which compacts the dough more.</li>
        <li>Trim off any ragged edges and discard them. To avoid toughening the dough, try to avoid rerolling it. Cut each portion of dough into 4 wedges or smaller rectangles.</li>
        <li> Heat at least 3 inches of oil in a heavy, high-sided saucepan or skillet to 400° F.</li>
        <li>Slip 1 or 2 dough pieces into the oil. After sinking briefly, the sopaipillas should begin to balloon and rise back to the surface.</li>
        <li>Once they start bobbing at the top, carefully spoon oil over them for the few seconds it will take until they have fully puffed. Turn them over (we like a long-handled slotted spoon for this) and cook just until they are golden. Drain.</li>
        <li>Arrange the sopaipillas in a napkin-lined basket and serve immediately with honey. Tear a corner off your sopaipilla to let steam escape, drizzle honey through the hole into the hollow center, and enjoy.</li></ol>
